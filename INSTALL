Some short install instructions:
You need: Qt4, wodim, cdrdao, growisofs, mpg123, ogg123, eject, kdesu

In order to build from sources perform the following steps:
qmake-qt4 turbojet2.pro
make

This will give you an executable in the subdir bin/ (called autojet)


Now you can install the software (default goes to /usr/local/)

As superuser do:
make install
